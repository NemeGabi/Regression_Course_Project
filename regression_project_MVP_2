The aim of the project to discover a selected features effect on a movie's total gross. One of the factor represents the gender of the directors what the project handle with particular attention.

At the current status of the project data was collected from Box Office Mojo about avor 4000 movies for the following features: domestic_gross', 'international_gross', 'running_time', 'release_date',
       'MPAA', 'distributor', 'in_release_days', 'genres', 'budget',
       'director', 'Op_weekend_gr', 'theatre'.

After data cleaning and some initial data engineering the below linear regression model was created with the numeric form of the exported features:

The model making discovered that the "in release" days have less whilst the number of theatres have more importancy then it was expected.

The model needs further data engineering to synchronize the model more on the data.
