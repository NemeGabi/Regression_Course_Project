Proposal for Project 2 - Linear Regression module


Question/need:

What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
How the domestic gross of the movie depends on the different features of the movie, main focus on the movies with female directors or female lead actresses

Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
We will see a wider picture how succesfull female directed movies or movies with female lead actress are compare to movies with male directors/lead actors. Gender diversifity is a very important topic in the movie industry (and in a lot of other industries as well) so I think any additional information about the current situation and maybe prediction of the future success of the female lead movies are highly valuable.


Data Description:

What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
I will use data from Mojo Office Box, and will get data with BeautifulSoup from the website

What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
Individual sample is one movie, the initial features what I am planning to use are the following:
- Gross Domestic
- Gross International
- Gross Worldwide
- In release
- Runing Time
- Widest Release
- Cast and Crew information:
 - Director
 - Lead actor/actress
- MPAA rating
- IMDB rating
- Genre
- Domestic Distributor


Tools:

How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
I would like to use BeautifulSoup to web scraping and then use SQL, Python Pandas for data manipulations

Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
I don't plan to use any additional tools
